groovy-tree
===========

A tree command by using groovy. Just for my exercise.

``tree`` command can be found both in windows and linux. It used for list contents of directories in a tree-like format.

``Tree.java`` is override for the ``groovyTree.groovy`` by using java code. Just for contrast.

Here is the screenshot for runtime both groovy and java.
